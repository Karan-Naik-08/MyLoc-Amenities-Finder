# MyLoc Amenities Finder

MyLoc Amenities Finder is a web-based application that helps users locate nearby amenities with visual cues for easier identification. The project categorizes amenities based on different categories using distinct color codes, and it adjusts the color density according to the user ratings of the amenities. KMeans clustering is utilized to group the amenities efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly way to find nearby amenities based on their location. By using KMeans clustering, the amenities are grouped into meaningful clusters, and the UI highlights these amenities with a color-coding scheme that distinguishes between categories and ratings.

### Key Features
- **Nearby Amenities:** Displays amenities around the user’s location.
- **Color Coding:** Each category of amenity has its unique color, making it easier to identify different types (e.g., restaurants, hospitals, schools).
- **Color Density:** The color shade of an amenity is based on user ratings, providing quick insights into the popularity and quality of the amenity.
- **KMeans Clustering:** Clusters the amenities into distinct groups, enhancing user experience and ease of navigation.
- **Flask-based Web Application:** Provides an interactive UI where users can search and view amenities with real-time clustering and color-coding.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** KMeans Clustering (using `sklearn`)
- **Other Libraries:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib for data processing and visualization.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**  
   Ensure you have all the required Python packages installed (`Flask`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, etc.).  
   Start the Flask server and access the application in your browser.

2. **Search for Amenities**  
   Input your location, and the app will display nearby amenities with clusters and appropriate color codes based on category and ratings.

3. **Visualize the Amenities**  
   Explore different amenities and use the color-coding to easily distinguish categories and understand ratings.
